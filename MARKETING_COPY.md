### Reddit (r/discordapp)

**Title:** Built a Discord security bot that outperforms Wick - it's free and open source

**Body:**
I've been working on a Discord security bot called Nexus that I believe is better than Wick. Here's why:

**Features:**

- All of Wick's core features (anti-raid, anti-nuke, heat system, etc.)
- AI-powered intelligence (smart recommendations, behavioral analysis)
- Threat intelligence network (cross-server threat sharing)
- Better user experience (interactive dashboard, smart error messages)
- 100% free (no premium tiers)
- Open source (full transparency)

**What makes it better:**

- AI learns from your server and suggests improvements
- Tracks user behavior patterns to detect threats early
- Shared threat database across all servers
- Auto-recovery system for server restoration
- Advanced reporting with insights

I know Wick has 848K servers, but I believe Nexus offers something different - it's the modern, open source alternative with AI features.

Would love your feedback! [link]
