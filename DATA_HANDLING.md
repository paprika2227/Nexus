## Auto-Recovery Snapshots

### What Data is Stored:

Recovery snapshots contain complete server structure data:
- **Channel Data**: IDs, names, types, positions, parent categories, and permission overwrites (including role/user IDs and specific permissions)
- **Role Data**: IDs, names, colors, permissions, positions, mentionable status, and hoist settings
- **Permission Overwrites**: Detailed permission settings for channels

### When Snapshots are Created:

- Automatically when the bot joins your server (initial snapshot)
- Periodically (every 24 hours if no recent snapshot exists)
- Before and after security incidents
- On-demand via commands (if available)

### Retention:

- **Active servers**: Snapshots retained for 90 days

- Old snapshots are automatically purged to maintain database size

### Purpose:

- Restore deleted channels and roles after nuke attacks
- Recover server structure and permissions
- Maintain server functionality after security incidents

### Security:

- Snapshots stored in encrypted database
- Only accessible to the bot for recovery purposes
- Not shared with third parties
