## What Actually Gets Users

### 1. Word of Mouth (40%)

- Quality creates advocates

## The Honest Pitch

**Don't say:**

- "Better than Wick" (can't prove it yet)
- "Join 848K servers" (you don't have that)
- "The best bot" (too early)

**Do say:**

- "New security bot with AI features"
- "Open source and free"
- "Try it and see"
- "We're building something different"

## Red Flags to Avoid

### ❌ Overpromising

- "Join millions of servers" (not realistic)

### ❌ Trash Talking

- "Wick is trash" (makes you look bad)
- "Wick users are dumb" (insults potential users)

### ❌ Spam

- Posting everywhere constantly
- Begging for votes
- Being annoying

### ❌ Copying

- "We're just like Wick" (why not use Wick?)
- No unique value

## What Works

### ✅ Being Honest

- "We're new, but we're different"
- "Try it, nothing to lose"
- "We're building something better"

### ✅ Unique Value

## The Realistic Path

1. **Start small** - 10-50 servers
2. **Make it perfect** - Fix every bug
3. **Get testimonials** - Happy users
4. **Build slowly** - Word of mouth
5. **Scale gradually** - Don't rush

**Don't try to beat Wick overnight.**
**Build something better, even if smaller.**
