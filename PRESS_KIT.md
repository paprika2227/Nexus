## 🎤 Sample Interview Questions & Answers

**Q: Why did you build Nexus?**
> "I was paying for a premium Discord security bot and realized the features weren't that complex - just well-executed. I wanted to see if I could build something similar that's completely free and open source. Turns out, you can!"

**Q: How is it free? What's the catch?**
> "No catch. I'm not monetizing it. It's a passion project to prove free, open-source bots can compete with premium ones. The code is on GitHub - you can verify there's no data mining or hidden costs."

**Q: How does it compare to Wick?**
> "Feature-wise, Nexus has more. We have AI prediction, custom workflows, and open-source transparency that Wick doesn't offer. Where Wick wins is scale and battle-testing - they have 100k+ servers and years of proven reliability. We're newer (18+ servers) but growing fast."

**Q: Sub-millisecond detection - is that actually true?**
> "Yes, and it's verifiable. Use the `/performance` command to see live metrics from production. We use Node.js's `process.hrtime.bigint()` for nanosecond-precision timing. The detection code itself is sub-millisecond - the Discord API adds 50-150ms for the actual ban, but that's unavoidable."

**Q: What's your goal with this project?**
> "Short term: Grow to 100+ servers with 99.9% uptime. Long term: Prove open source can compete with premium products at scale. Ultimate goal: 1,000+ servers, professional infrastructure, community-driven development."

**Q: Are you looking for funding/monetization?**
> "Not currently. This is a learning project and community service. If it scales to the point where hosting costs are significant, I'd consider optional donations, but the bot will always be free to use."

**Q: How can people contribute?**
> "GitHub PRs are welcome! Also looking for beta testers, documentation writers, and eventually community moderators for the support server. All contributors get credit and special roles."
