8. Open a Pull Request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or higher
- npm or yarn
- SQLite3
- A Discord bot application (from Discord Developer Portal)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone your fork

npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your bot token and configuration
nano .env

# Initialize database
npm run db:init

# Start development
npm run dev
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all new features are documented
2. **Update Tests**: Add/update tests for your changes
3. **Update Changelog**: Add your changes to `docs/changelog.html`
4. **Follow Coding Standards**: Ensure your code follows our style guide
5. **Pass All Checks**: All automated tests must pass
6. **Get Reviews**: At least one maintainer must approve your PR

### PR Title Format

Use conventional commits format:

- `feat: Add new command`
- `fix: Resolve database connection issue`
- `docs: Update README`
- `test: Add unit tests for automod`
- `refactor: Improve performance of cache system`

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style

- Use ES6+ features
- Use `const` by default, `let` when reassignment needed
- Never use `var`
- Use template literals for string concatenation
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Use async/await over Promise chains

### Naming Conventions

- `camelCase` for variables and functions
- `PascalCase` for classes
- `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- Descriptive names over abbreviations

### Comments

- Use JSDoc for function documentation
- Comment complex logic
- Don't comment obvious code
- Keep comments up-to-date

Example:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate server security score
 * @param {string} guildId - Discord guild ID
 * @param {Object} config - Server configuration
 * @returns {Promise<number>} Security score (0-100)
 */
async function calculateSecurityScore(guildId, config) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Error Handling

- Always handle errors gracefully
- Use try/catch for async operations
- Log errors with context
- Provide user-friendly error messages

### Database Operations

- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Use transactions for multiple related operations
- Always close database connections
- Handle connection errors

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/automod.test.js

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names

Example:

```javascript
describe('AutoMod System', () => {
  test('should detect spam messages', async () => {
    const message = createMockMessage('spam spam spam');
    const result = await automod.checkMessage(message);
    expect(result.isSpam).toBe(true);
  });

  test('should handle database errors gracefully', async () => {
    // Simulate database error
    db.get = jest.fn().mockRejectedValue(new Error('DB Error'));
    const result = await automod.getConfig('123');
    expect(result).toBe(null);
  });
});
```
